    <h2>Proper Usage</h2>
    <p>The Discord Bot Application Evo stores channelIDs, guildIDs and userIDs. We will ONLY store said IDs if the bot requires it to complete actions within your server.  If you would like to delete your data, disable the systems that store it.  You can also join our support server to request personal data deletion.</p>
